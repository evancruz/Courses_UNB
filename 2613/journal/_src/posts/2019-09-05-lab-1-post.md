Most of the concepts introduced in this lab are things that I already knew, such as using a terminal editor (nano specifically) and the use of git. What I learned from this lab, was how to use racket and frog to build a blog.
I installed racket on my personal computer and learned how to add it to my $Path environment so that I can run the commands. It was difficult at first but knowing how to use nano and knowing my way around a terminal helped immensely in adding the previous step. Lastly, as for readings I was required to read the syllabus and the quick start guide for creating this blog.
