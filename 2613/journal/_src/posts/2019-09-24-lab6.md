Lab 6 was difficult for me as the concepts introduced to me were concepts that I have little knowledge about. The first was [Hash Tables](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/hash-tables.html?q=racket-lang.org) which I've never actually implemented before. I was surprised to find out that they are immutable and unable to be me modified. When a function is called to change the order, add, or remove elements in a hash table such as [hash-set](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/hashtables.html#%28elem._%28caveat._mutable-keys%29%29) then it actually creates a new hash rather than modify the hash table passed in as an argument. Next, we learned about plotting using the _calculus.rkt_ file. This was later discussed as a class as to how **visualization** is applied to software development. The conclusion drawn was that it's used in [Data Driven Development](https://www.targetprocess.com/blog/data-driven-development/) where the ouput depends on the input (and only on the input). And aside from this, it's also useful for debugging. Lastly, I practiced how to parse [JSON](http://www.json.org/) data (something I had never done before) and it was interesting to learn! It combined some concepts from hash tables that we had practiced earlier in the lab as well. I'm sure that these concepts will surface again in the midterm and final exam, which means that I will need to practice outside of lab times to ensure that the concepts are engrained in my mind, since as mentioned before that it's an area where I have a knowledge gap. Overall, it was a learning experience and I know it will be useful in a work environment.
