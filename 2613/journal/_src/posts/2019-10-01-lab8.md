**Javascript!** Finally, Racket has been dethroned and there is a new king. Although Javascript is known to be on the of the [worst programming languages](https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/the-top-10-things-wrong-with-javascript-58f440d6b3d8) in existence, it's still a breath of fresh air. The first task was to run a hello world javascript program (of course). From there we learned how to use the web console. In the web console, we ran a script (the hello world file) and learned how to start up a [node repl](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html). It was after this, that Racket decided to try to make a comeback and we were required to translate Racket into Javascript. Another task was to create looping triangle which was trivial since it's one of the easiest things to do. Afterwards, some required readings included a talk by [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), learning about special numbers, and type conversion. What's interesting about how null is implemented in Javascript is the fact that it's an object reference and hency why it "interacts with JavaScript's Automatic Type Conversion in odd ways". The FizzBuzz problem is something I've solved in the past, so I skipped this part as I figured it would be a waste of time. Now that I've linked a resource that describes why Javascript is considered one of the worst languages, now I must say that there are reasons to consider why one should learn it anyway! According to [mashable](https://mashable.com/2018/02/23/javascript-bundle-class-course-ebook-sale/), Javascript is in high demand, and has lucrative pay. In fact, in my last co-op many teams used Javascript to work on their projects as Javascript is the most widely used languages when it comes to web development. There are many frameworks to use, including for testing such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
