Scribble was introduced today and the most interesting part about it was the fact that functions could be defined and used in a blog post. Another concept introduced was modules which are similar to Java's [import](https://www.leepoint.net/language/10basics/import.html) or Javascript's [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export). One of the things I practiced was debugging and recursion, and in doing so I found an interesting error. In the **else** part of this code block:

``` 
(define (fact n)
      (cond
        [(zero? n) 1]
        [else                     ])) 
```

I put: 

```
(fact (* n (n-1)))
```

which caused DrRacket to give me this error *n-1: unbound identifier in: n-1* and I very quickly realized that how I'm used to programming in other languages actually became a hindrance here. Racket was looking for a id named *n-1* and I thought it would know that I wanted to pass the variable *n* subtracted by 1. Finally, there were no explicit readings but rather suggested readings. We were required to push all of our work for this lab and of course this post!
