In this lab, there were familiar concepts such as recursion, and unit tests, but there was also an unfamiliar concept introduced to me called _Git Bisect_.
In regards to unit tests, I learned about this at a job placement and actually wrote test cases in Jest for a business product that was being developed using something called  [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), so doing unit tests in Racket was a bit of a refresher.
I also practiced function definitions and working through recursion. I did find that making my own mapper function was difficult but that was mainly because I still didnt know enough about the language and had to work through documentation to get up to speed. 
Tasks given in this lab included reading [Racket Recursion](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Lists__Iteration__and_Recursion.html#%28part._.List_.Iteration_from_.Scratch%29) of the Racket Guide which explains how to recursively traverse a list, reading "The Beautiful Racket unit test explainer", and creating complete test code coverage for the **file.rkt** code.
