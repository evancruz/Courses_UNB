When we form a list, we always start out with the empty list. In BSL, we represent the empty list with '()
 Like #true or 5, '() is just a constant. When we add something to a list, we construct another list
; in BSL, the cons operation serves this purpose. For example,
(cons "Mercury" '())
constructs a list from the '() list and the string "Mercury".
The box for cons has two fields: first and rest.

(cons "Venus"
  (cons "Mercury"
    '()))
First = venus, rest = first = "mercury" rest = '()
